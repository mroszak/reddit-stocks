# Render Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Client Build Directory
- **Problem**: The client build directory was not being created during deployment
- **Fix**: Updated `render.yaml` to use `npm run render-postbuild` instead of the shell script
- **Changes**: Modified the buildCommand in render.yaml to use npm scripts

### 2. dataProcessor.processRedditPosts Function Error
- **Problem**: monitoringService was calling a non-existent function
- **Fix**: Added the missing `processRedditPosts` function to dataProcessor.js
- **Changes**: 
  - Added new function in dataProcessor.js to handle array of posts
  - Updated monitoringService.js to pass subreddit name to the function

### 3. Build Scripts Optimization
- **Fix**: Updated package.json build scripts to ensure server dependencies are installed first
- **Changes**: Added `npm install &&` to the beginning of build scripts

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment issues - client build and dataProcessor"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Render will automatically detect the changes and redeploy

3. Monitor the deployment logs to ensure:
   - Client build completes successfully
   - No more dataProcessor errors
   - The application starts properly

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. Your app URL should load the React frontend
2. The monitoring service should process posts without errors
3. API endpoints should be accessible at `/api/health`

## Additional Notes

- The client build will now happen automatically during deployment
- The monitoring service will properly process Reddit posts
- All automated tasks should run without errors
